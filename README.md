# BroadcastReceiverSMS
BroadcastReceiverSMS is a practice for several abilities in Android programming.

The application shows a few website URLs that the user can click on. The chosen website appears in the second half of the screen. The broadcast receiver listens for SMS messages. If a URL is sent to the user, then the URL is added to the list of websites that can be chosen. The broadcast receiver is no longer functioning thanks to updated security on Android devices, but was functioning when this code was written.
